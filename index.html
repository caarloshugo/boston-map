When converted into 4-ounce servings, this is equivalent to over 1.2 million servings of fresh, local produce that would have otherwise gone to waste. The Ride for Food is a tremendous boost to us financially, and is helping us towards our goal of tripling the number of farms we glean and in order to rescue 1.2 million servings of fresh fruit and vegetables each year. Ride with us to make this a reality!";
text[1] = "<p><strong><center>Ripples of Hope – Harvesting Seeds of Hope</strong></p></center> <b> Harvesting Seeds of Hope is a Ripples of Hope initiative which works to develop and fund community based food insecurity programs. In 2014 the Ride for Food provided critical funds in support of our program with Pine Street Inn’s permanent resident housing in Jamaica Plain to teach the basics of growing vegetables and the importance of fresh produce in maintaining a healthy diet. The Ride for Food epitomizes the spirit of philanthropy in action and will help us to sustain and expand these important community-based initiatives for Ripples of Hope.";
text[2] = "<p><strong><center>Dedham Food Pantry</strong></p></center> <b> As we begin our 25th year of service to the community, we have grown to serve approximately 300 Dedham families in need, and distribute roughly 175,000 pounds of food each year. The Ride for Food has been transformative for us. It is our biggest fundraiser by far. It has helped us purchase more vegetables, fruit, milk and eggs, increase the number of visits per family, and allowed us to expand the opportunity for seniors to shop by adding an additional day to the schedule. The Ride for Food has not only increased our overall funding, but has increased awareness in the community for our work and the need we seek to address.";
text[3] = "<p><strong><center>Food for Free</strong></p></center> <b> Food For Free responds to local hunger by rescuing fresh food that would otherwise go to waste and distributing it within the emergency food system where it can reach those in need. Our four main programs include 1) Food Rescue - serving 100+ food programs across 12 cities, 2) Home Delivery bringing food to 95 clients each month who are unable to access food pantries, 3) Field of Greens which is our own small farm program which harvests and then distributes 4,000-8,000 pounds of vegetables among the food programs we serve, and our 4) Transportation Partnership which picks up food from the Greater Boston Food Bank for 12 different food pantries. The Ride for Food offers us a way to raise significant funds at a very low cost ensuring every dollar raised goes that much further. It’s created an opportunity to expand our community and to partner with other food programs to raise awareness around community hunger and food justice. It has been an incredibly valuable resource to Food for Free.";

We currently serve more than 100 people per month, many of whom have never previously asked for this kind of help. The Ride for Food has provided us with the opportunity to serve more people and increase the amount of food we distribute. Prior to participating in the Ride we were in grave danger of closing doors or decreasing the number of days open per month. Since our initial involvement with the Ride for Food we have achieved a comfort level that allows us to feel certain we can sustain the Food Pantry. Additionally, we have gained momentum in the community through outreach to various community stakeholders and business people. For all this we, and our visitors, are eternally grateful.";

We are the town’s only Food Pantry and currently serve an average of over 200 households per month, a significant increase over the past few years. Being part of the Ride for Food has been a huge benefit for our organization. Not only did we raise a significant amount of money, but it also increased the level of awareness in our community. Over and over we heard from donors to the Ride for Food that they “had no idea” of the level of food insecurity in our town and how happy they were to be asked by a rider to help support the Council’s mission to ensure that all Needham households have adequate food.";

It’s also increased our client satisfaction through the additional choices we can offer and the improvements to the space in which we work. Overall, the Ride has benefited our pantry financially from an increase in awareness of our mission and needs. Please ride with us in September.";

Food from our farms is distributed through our community supported agriculture programs and farmers’ markets, and donated to local hunger relief organizations. Money raised from the Ride for Food is used to help pay for our Farm to Family program, a subsidized CSA program that serves low-income families in Boston neighborhoods. The Ride for Food allowed us the opportunity to put our cause in front of people who otherwise might not know about us, gaining new community participation awareness. Last year, 2014, was our first year of participation, but we anticipate that we grow as part of the Ride as it continues to grow.";
